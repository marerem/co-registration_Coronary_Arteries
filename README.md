# App for co-registering image sequences using a novel spline-based approach

This app enhances processing speed by 40x, allowing the co-registration of a sequence of 300 frames in just 5 seconds. It is compatible with Windows and MacOS and is powered by a novel spline-based algorithm developed at MITâ€™s Edelman Lab. Originally designed for medical hardware, it efficiently aligns videos with rotational, transverse, and displacement adjustments.
