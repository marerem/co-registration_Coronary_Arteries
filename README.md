# Spline Co-Registration of Coronary Artery Imaging

This Spline approuch, with a graphical user interface (GUI), assists in co-registering two sequences of images by aligning one sequence to another based on user-selected checkpoints.

## Motivation

Doctors use a catheter with a camera to examine coronary arteries. Before and after procedures like stent placements, two sets of images are obtained. These sets start and end at different points, have different angles, and contain a different number of frames. Manually aligning these images is challenging and time-consuming. This user-friendly GUI simplifies the alignment process, making it quicker and easier.

## Complexity and Runtime

The algorithm has a complexity of O(n), where n is the number of frames in a sequence. 

### Runtime Performance

- **Average Time per 250 Frames:** 5 seconds

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

Steps to install the project.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coronary-artery-imaging.git
cd coronary-artery-imaging

# Create and activate a virtual environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate coronary-artery-imaging

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
